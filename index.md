Hi there!  

My name is Joseph, and I'm a developer with goals.  I make things like android apps, interactive & custom styled maps, software in C and Java, creative encryption solutions, and Raspberry Pi & Arduino gadgets.  I know Java, C, C++, PHP, HTML & CSS, Git, C#, jQuery, node.js, Python, Solidity, and probably a few others by now.  I've built projects using APIs from Bloomberg, Twilio, Twitter, IBM, Mapbox, and others.  You can check out any of my open source projects on [Github](https://github.com/jschiarizzi)!

When I'm not working on some awesome coding project I love to swim, hike, cook, play video games, and learn new skills.  I plan to use this website to share the things I'm working on with anyone who is interested.  I have also spent a lot of time building developer communities through events like [Hackital](http://hackital.io), a hackathon in the capital.

If you like one of my projects or have a cool idea let me know!  If you want to contribute to a repository, go ahead and send a pull request.
