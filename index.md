Hi there!  

I'm a developer with goals.  I make things like android apps, minecraft plugins, software in C and Java, creative encyption solutions, and Raspberry Pi gadgets.  I know Java, C, C#, Javascript, PHP, HTML & CSS, Git, and I'm learning Python this summer.  You can check out any of my open source projects on [Github](https://github.com/jschiarizzi)!

When I'm not working on some awesome coding project I love to swim, hike, cook, play video games, and learn new skills.  I plan to use this website to share interesting things I'm working on with anyone who is interested.

If you like one of my projects or have a cool idea let me know!  If you want to contribute to a repository, go ahead and send a pull request.
