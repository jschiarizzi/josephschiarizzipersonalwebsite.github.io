Why should we use simple plain text to encrypt messages when we can combine amplitudes, frequencies, and wavelength of sound waves.  This open source project, created at Bit Camp 2016, lets you add secret encrypted messages to .WAV files and share.  Add a secure secret message to the background of your favorite song, send it to your friend, and they can decrypt it with your shared key!

BusiScan is an android application that allows users to take pictures of business cards to instantly add all information on it to their contacts in their phone.  The android side was mostly developed by my friend [Amitav Khandel](http://www.amitavkhandelwal.com/), and amazing developer.  The project utilizes [HP's Idol onDemand API](https://dev.havenondemand.com/apis) to convert from pictures to text and included a backend to allow business owners to check where their cards are being scanned.
