My name is Joseph Schiarizzi and I'm a Computer Science student at The George Washington University. I love problem solving and trying out new technology.  I spend a lot of time working on [Hackital](hackital.io) - a hackathon in the capital, which I am the Director of.  

You can take a look at my open source projects on [GitHub](https://www.github.com/jschiarizzi). If you see something you like, enjoyed one of my blog posts, or use one of my applications, share the love and [buy me a slice of pizza](https://www.paypal.me/JosephSchiarizzi)!
