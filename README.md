## Website Design

Credit for the original design and inspiration of this website goes to [Erik Eng](http://erikeng.se/). While many of his design elements are still in use in this website's current design, Matt made the following changes to his code:

* Translated to english
* Cleaned up the HTML code and stripped out most of the social integration
* Modified some of the styles and layouts
* Eliminated the need to compile client-side before deploying
* Added support for Disqus comments
* Added support for LinkedIn link in the About include
* Website is now W3C valid and follows all HTML5 standards
