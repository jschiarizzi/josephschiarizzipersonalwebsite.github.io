title: "Own your own identity + simple branded tokens to make blockchain projects whole"
---

We are already through [OST's](https://ost.com) Alpha III Challenge. OST lets people easily create their own branded token with a dashboard all setup to get info on transactions, users, and with lots of options.  I'm currently building an integration for OST and [uport](https://www.uport.me/) so OST users can log in with one account they control and interact with different dapp ecosystems.


## Status Update
This week we finished up our [uport-connect](https://github.com/uport-project/uport-identity) integration.  Now you can log in with a uport button which generates QR codes and allows the user to verify.
