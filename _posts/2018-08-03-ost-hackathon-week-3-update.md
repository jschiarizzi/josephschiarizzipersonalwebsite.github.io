title: "uport + OST integration update 3"
---

Wow there is only another week left in this hackathon!  Time flies when you're building.

If you have not read my previous updates check them out here: [One](http://josephschiarizzi.com/2018/07/Own-your-own-identity-plus-OST/), [Two](http://josephschiarizzi.com/2018/07/ost-uport-50-percent/).  They explain why I have been building this project, my motivation, and the over all goals.  I think the integration between uport and OST is worth the time.

This will be a quicker update since I've been extra busy this week.  Hopefully the integration between uport will be complete this weekend, with another more substantial update to come in a few days.

## What progress did you make on your Alpha III POC this week?
This week we wrote the API calls that will be made to OST for each project a suser adds to their uport profile. We've written it for the generic case, so any OST project can be added and users will be able to log in with uport to interact with multiple OST projects at once.

Calls look like this
