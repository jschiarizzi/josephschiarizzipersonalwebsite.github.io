Today I started a project with my friend, Rowland.  He is what one might consider a data nerd.  We were given access to some US government data on education from IBM, as part of an event hosted by [GW Data](https://www.facebook.com/GWDataScience/).

We had a few ideas about comparing various educations statatistics for the country with income tax rates and school funding data found here: https://www.usaspending.gov/transparency/Pages/SpendingMap.aspx

More coming soon.
